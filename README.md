# About

The name of this repo, *nihongo-benkyou* ([日本語](http://tangorin.com/general/%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E8%AA%9E)[勉強](http://tangorin.com/general/%E5%8B%89%E5%BC%B7)), translates as *Japanese language study*.

It contains various notes and translations in easy to parse formats such as [json](http://json.org).

Using [github](https://github.com/) to track my progress is a new experiment. 

If I have made mistakes, send me a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with your corrections or clarifications.

## Weekly Calendars

At the end of 2014, I was given two weekly 2015 calendars in Japanese as gifts:

* [Kotowaza](kotowaza) or proverbs
* [Yojijukugo](yojijukugo) or four-character idioms

I have started translating each calendar into individual json files, one file per weekly entry, and I am happy to share them here.
